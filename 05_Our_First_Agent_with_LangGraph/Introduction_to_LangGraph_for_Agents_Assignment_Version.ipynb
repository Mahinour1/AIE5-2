        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

We detail the process of adapting this large\\nlanguage model to the Arabic domain, using diverse datasets including Bactrian,\\nOpenAssistant, and Wikipedia Arabic corpora. Our methodology involves custom\\ndata preprocessing, model configuration, and training optimization techniques\\nsuch as gradient accumulation and mixed-precision training. We address specific\\nchallenges in Arabic NLP, including morphological complexity, dialectal\\nvariations, and diacritical mark handling. Experimental results over 10,000\\ntraining steps show significant performance improvements, with the final loss\\nconverging to 0.1083. We provide comprehensive analysis of GPU memory usage,\\ntraining dynamics, and model evaluation across various Arabic language tasks,\\nincluding text classification, question answering, and dialect identification.\\nThe fine-tuned model demonstrates robustness to input perturbations and\\nimproved handling of Arabic-specific linguistic phenomena. This research\\ncontributes to multilingual AI by demonstrating a resource-efficient approach\\nfor creating specialized language models, potentially democratizing access to\\nadvanced NLP technologies for diverse linguistic communities.

However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA.

We fine-tuned\\nthe original 8B parameters instruction tuned model using the Supervised\\nFine-tuning (SFT) technique on the English and Italian language datasets in\\norder to improve the original performance. Consequently, a Dynamic Preference\\nOptimization (DPO) process has been used to align preferences, avoid dangerous\\nand inappropriate answers, and limit biases and prejudices. Our model leverages\\nthe efficiency of QLoRA to fine-tune the model on a smaller portion of the\\noriginal model weights and then adapt the model specifically for the Italian\\nlinguistic structure, achieving significant improvements in both performance\\nand computational efficiency. Concurrently, DPO is employed to refine the\\nmodel\\'s output, ensuring that generated content aligns with quality answers.\\nThe synergy between SFT, QLoRA\\'s parameter efficiency and DPO\\'s user-centric\\noptimization results in a robust LLM that excels in a variety of tasks,\\nincluding but not limited to text completion, zero-shot classification, and\\ncontextual understanding. The model has been extensively evaluated over\\nstandard benchmarks for the Italian and English languages, showing outstanding\\nresults. The model is freely available over the HuggingFace hub and, examples\\nof use can be found in our GitHub repository.\\nhttps://huggingface.co/swap-uniba/LLaMAntino-3-ANITA-8B-Inst-DPO-ITA\\n\\nPublished: 2024-10-08\\nTitle: SpaLLM: Unified Compressive Adaptation of Large Language Models with Sketching\\nAuthors: Tianyi Zhang, Junda Su, Oscar Wu, Zhaozhuo Xu, Anshumali Shrivastava\\nSummary: Compressive adaptation approaches, such as QLoRA, are widely popular\\nalternatives for reducing memory requirements during fine-tuning of large\\nlanguage models (LLMs) while producing models capable of handling various\\ndownstream tasks. The key idea is to employ a \"two-tower\" architecture:\\ncompressing pre-trained LLM parameters into compact representations and\\nfine-tuning the additive full-precision adapter, which typically has few\\ntunable parameters in low-rank format. However, the strict algebraic\\nassumptions, such as low-rank assumption, and the complexity of composing\\ntwo-tower architectures are some of the known shortcomings, resulting in a poor\\naccuracy-efficiency trade-off. In response to these known limitations, we\\npropose SpaLLM (Sketched Parameter Adaptation of LLMs), a novel compressive\\nadaptation approach for LLMs. This method is also the first to illustrate\\nparameter-sharing compression methods for LLM fine-tuning, which, unlike QLoRA,\\nare free from strict low-rank algebraic assumptions on adapters. Furthermore,\\nour proposal unifies model compression and adaptation into a single,\\nstreamlined process, eliminating the need for two-tower architectures. SpaLLM\\nsketches pre-trained LLM weights into lookup tables and directly fine-tunes the\\nvalues in these tables. This approach simplifies LLMs\\' compressive adaptation\\nworkflow, potentially improves multi-user serving efficiency, and delivers\\nsignificantly better accuracy for both natural language understanding and\\ngeneration tasks. Moreover, by avoiding the \"two-tower\" architecture, our\\nframework only requires one compressed matrix multiplication per layer during\\ninference, demonstrating superior inference efficiency compared to previous\\nmethods.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-28\\nTitle: PiSSA: Principal Singular Values and Singular Vectors Adaptation of Large Language Models\\nAuthors: Fanxu Meng, Zhaohui Wang, Muhan Zhang\\nSummary: To parameter-efficiently fine-tune (PEFT) large language models (LLMs), the\\nlow-rank adaptation (LoRA) method approximates the model changes $\\\\Delta W \\\\in', name='arxiv', id='0573ddfd-14f9-418d-8430-268566d47631', tool_call_id='call_jbeYcMWLKL1WElKjCrzcMQI8')]}\n"

This paradigm presents challenges for\\nsystems that serve real-time responses to queries that each involve a different\\nLoRA. Prior works optimize the design of such systems but still require\\ncontinuous loading and offloading of LoRAs, as it is infeasible to store\\nthousands of LoRAs in GPU memory. To mitigate this issue, we investigate the\\nefficacy of model compression when serving LoRAs. We propose a method for joint\\ncompression of LoRAs into a shared basis paired with LoRA-specific scaling\\nmatrices. We extend our algorithm to learn clusters of LoRAs that are more\\namenable to joint compression, allowing it to scale gracefully to large LoRA\\ncollections. Our experiments with up to 500 LoRAs demonstrate that compressed\\nLoRAs preserve performance while offering major throughput gains in realistic\\nserving scenarios with over a thousand LoRAs, maintaining 80% of the throughput\\nof serving a single LoRA.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-10-28\\nTitle: KD-LoRA: A Hybrid Approach to Efficient Fine-Tuning with LoRA and Knowledge Distillation\\nAuthors: Rambod Azimi, Rishav Rishav, Marek Teichmann, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou\\nSummary: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across\\nvarious downstream tasks. However, the high computational and memory\\nrequirements of LLMs are a major bottleneck. To address this,\\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank adaptation\\n(LoRA) have been proposed to reduce computational costs while ensuring minimal\\nloss in performance. Additionally, knowledge distillation (KD) has been a\\npopular choice for obtaining compact student models from teacher models. In\\nthis work, we present KD-LoRA, a novel fine-tuning method that combines LoRA\\nwith KD. Our results demonstrate that KD-LoRA achieves performance comparable\\nto full fine-tuning (FFT) and LoRA while significantly reducing resource\\nrequirements. Specifically, KD-LoRA retains 98% of LoRA's performance on the\\nGLUE benchmark, while being 40% more compact. Additionally, KD-LoRA reduces GPU\\nmemory usage by 30% compared to LoRA, while decreasing inference time by 30%\\ncompared to both FFT and LoRA. We evaluate KD-LoRA across three encoder-only\\nmodels: BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTaV3.

However, their general ability to improve\\nthe performance of physiological signal deep learning model is immature. In\\nthis study, we experimentally analyze four attention mechanisms (e.g.,\\nsqueeze-and-excitation, non-local, convolutional block attention module, and\\nmulti-head self-attention) and three convolutional neural network (CNN)\\narchitectures (e.g., VGG, ResNet, and Inception) for two representative\\nphysiological signal prediction tasks: the classification for predicting\\nhypotension and the regression for predicting cardiac output (CO). We evaluated\\nmultiple combinations for performance and convergence of physiological signal\\ndeep learning model. Accordingly, the CNN models with the spatial attention\\nmechanism showed the best performance in the classification problem, whereas\\nthe channel attention mechanism achieved the lowest error in the regression\\nproblem. Moreover, the performance and convergence of the CNN models with\\nattention mechanisms were better than stand-alone self-attention models in both\\nproblems. Hence, we verified that convolutional operation and attention\\nmechanisms are complementary and provide faster convergence time, despite the\\nstand-alone self-attention models requiring fewer parameters.\\n\\nPublished: 2018-10-17\\nTitle: An Analysis of Attention Mechanisms: The Case of Word Sense Disambiguation in Neural Machine Translation\\nAuthors: Gongbo Tang, Rico Sennrich, Joakim Nivre\\nSummary: Recent work has shown that the encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in neural\\nmachine translation (NMT) are different from the word alignment in statistical\\nmachine translation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing encoder-decoder\\nattention mechanisms, in the case of word sense disambiguation (WSD) in NMT\\nmodels. We hypothesize that attention mechanisms pay more attention to context\\ntokens when translating ambiguous words. We explore the attention distribution\\npatterns when translating ambiguous nouns. Counter-intuitively, we find that\\nattention mechanisms are likely to distribute more attention to the ambiguous\\nnoun itself rather than context tokens, in comparison to other nouns. We\\nconclude that attention mechanism is not the main mechanism used by NMT models\\nto incorporate contextual information for WSD. The experimental results suggest\\nthat NMT models learn to encode contextual information necessary for WSD in the\\nencoder hidden states. For the attention mechanism in Transformer models, we\\nreveal that the first few layers gradually learn to \"align\" source and target\\ntokens and the last few layers learn to extract features from the related but\\nunaligned context tokens.', name='arxiv', id='1742fbed-41f6-4981-9dc7-10276fd9fb07', tool_call_id='call_wgTks2dtMQ2PGnb3MwLi2UUh')]\n",

Recent research has focused on optimizing the deployment of LoRA at scale, such as compressing multiple LoRA adapters into a shared basis to improve throughput and reduce resource usage. LoRA is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple fine-tuned versions of a model need to be served simultaneously, as it allows for efficient storage and retrieval of these adaptations.\\n\\n### Tim Dettmers\\nTim Dettmers is a research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI and an incoming assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University.

            "Prompt engineering is the process of designing inputs for generative artificial intelligence (AI) models to deliver useful, accurate, and relevant responses. It is particularly used with large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google Gemini. The goal is to optimize the output from these models by crafting well-engineered prompts, which can lead to improved results and efficiency. This practice is crucial in fields like customer support, content generation, and data analysis, where minimizing bias and maximizing relevance in AI outputs are essential. [Source](https://www.britannica.com/technology/prompt-engineering), [Source](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-prompt-engineering).\n",
            "\n",
            "**History:**\n",
            "The history of prompt engineering is intertwined with the development of AI and language models. It can be traced back to early code generation tools like CodeSmith and MyGeneration, which automated the creation of boilerplate code. As large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 became more complex, prompt engineering evolved to meet the challenges of these advanced systems. The field has seen significant advancements, particularly with the introduction of reinforcement learning techniques that have enhanced the controllability and adaptability of language models. This evolution reflects humanity's ongoing quest for meaningful communication and interaction with AI.

            "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances generative AI models by integrating information retrieval capabilities. This approach allows models to respond to user queries by referencing a specified set of documents, augmenting the information drawn from their static training data. RAG is particularly useful for tasks requiring deep understanding, contextual awareness, and factual precision, and is already being applied across various industries.\n",
            "\n",
            "The concept of RAG was introduced in a 2020 paper by researchers from Facebook AI Research (now Meta AI), University College London, and New York University. The paper described RAG as a \"general-purpose fine-tuning recipe\" that can be used by nearly any large language model (LLM) to connect with external resources. This technique has since evolved, with advancements such as the Modular RAG framework and AutoRAG, which optimize the RAG pipeline for specific datasets.\n",
            "\n",
            "RAG has gained popularity due to its ability to improve the precision and reliability of AI models by retrieving and generating contextually suitable content. It represents a significant advancement in the field of generative AI, offering innovative opportunities for the conceptualization and deployment of AI systems.\n",

            "Fine-tuning is a process in machine learning where a pre-trained model is further trained on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This allows the model to adapt to specific tasks or domains while leveraging the general knowledge it has already acquired during its initial training on a larger dataset. Fine-tuning is particularly useful because it can significantly reduce the amount of data and computational resources required to train a model for a specific task, as the model starts with a strong foundation of general knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fine-tuning became prominent with the rise of transfer learning techniques, especially in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. In NLP, the introduction of models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in 2018 popularized the concept of fine-tuning. BERT and similar models are pre-trained on large corpora of text and then fine-tuned on specific tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, or named entity recognition.\n",

            "In computer vision, fine-tuning has been used for a longer time, with models like AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet being pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet and then fine-tuned for specific image classification tasks.\n",

These agents are text-based and leverage the capabilities of large language models to perform tasks that require understanding and generating human-like text. They significantly outperform earlier agents that were based on rules or reinforcement learning due to their generality and few-shot learning capabilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "The concept of agents in AI has been around for a while, with early examples like ELIZA in 1966, which was a rule-based system. However, LLM-based agents represent a more advanced stage in this evolution, combining reasoning and acting to enable decision-making across various domains. This makes them highly versatile and capable of solving complex problems in fields like software engineering, scientific discovery, and web automation.\n",
            "\n",
            "The development of LLM-based agents is part of a broader trend in AI, where the focus has shifted from symbolic AI and rule-based systems to more flexible and generalizable models like LLMs. This shift has been a significant driver of innovation across industries.\n",
